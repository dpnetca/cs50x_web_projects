# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


As I am simply autiding this course and will not be submitting for certificate. Most project will probably not be submitted.
I am submitting this one simply to understand the submission process to help someone on the slack channel who is struggling with it.
I will not be doing the youtube video portion of th requirments, and have yet to decide if I will submit the other projects.
The projects will however be posted to my github repo (linked below).
However, because I am doing this for personal learning, and not for course credit there will likely be some liberties taken with the projects.
Some projects will not meet all stated objectives.  Specifically this project does include the SCSS objective at this time, all other
objectives should be addressed.

* project included four pages
* all pages include a list with links to other pages
* all pages include custom style sheet and bootstrap style sheet
* stylesheet element requirement are met on the project requirements page
* mobile responsiveness included in all pages (background color change)
* about me uses the bootstrap elements
* SCSS skipped, sorry, may add this to personal repo later
* description here and in readme
