        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>I am auditing a course through <a href=https://edx.org>edx </a> called CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript offered by Harvardx</p>
        <p>This page is greated to complete Project 0</p>
        <p>
            As I am simply autiding this course and will not be submitting for certificate. Most project will probably not be submitted.
            I am submitting this one simply to understand the submission process to help someone on the slack channel who is struggling with it.
            I will not be doing the youtube video portion of th requirments, and have yet to decide if I will submit the other projects.
            The projects will however be posted to my github repo (linked below).
            However, because I am doing this for personal learning, and not for course credit there will likely be some liberties taken with the projects.
            Some projects will not meet all stated objectives. and will may have some extra elements
        </p>
