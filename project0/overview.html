        <h1>Project Overview / Writeup</h1>
        <p>
                As I am simply autiding this course and will not be submitting for certificate. Most project will probably not be submitted.
                I am submitting this one simply to understand the submission process to help someone on the slack channel who is struggling with it.
                I will not be doing the youtube video portion of th requirments, and have yet to decide if I will submit the other projects.
                The projects will however be posted to my github repo (linked below).
                However, because I am doing this for personal learning, and not for course credit there will likely be some liberties taken with the projects.
                Some projects will not meet all stated objectives.  Specifically this project does include the SCSS objective at this time, all other
                objectives should be addressed.
        </p>
